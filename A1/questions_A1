Part A (10 pts):
Run the Jupyter Notebook "Assignment 1.ipynb" (located in the "sharednotebooks" folder).  Make sure you understand what the notebook is doing.

Run an experiment in which you measure the classification performance of yourself and of the MLP network over 20 examples at each of the following noise levels:  0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%.  Plot a graph of noise level v.s. correct classifications (out of 20) with two lines, one for your performance, the second for the MLP.

Part B (20 pts):
Repeat Part A, but train the MLP on noisy data in addition to the perfect data.  Make sure that when you test the MLP you generate new noisy images (don't reuse the ones that you used during training).  Plot the graph.
